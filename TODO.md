## Taxo Bingo

Step 1: Resources (Taxonomic Category Words, Images and Names of organisms + all their belonging taxonomic categories for each)

Step 2: Bingo Grid 3x4 âœ“

Step 3: Organisms appear, clicking correct cell puts them there and makes them skip to next

Step 4: Skip Button functionality

Step 5: Flling all wins the game

Step 5.5: CSV rework

Step 6: Timer selected at the start

Step 7: Add "With Hint" button. Names only show if you chose With Hint, otherwise

Step 8: Give Up Flag Button below the grid

Step 9a: Progress is saved (until daily reset), entering on the same day doesnt lead to the panel menu, it leads directly to the already-started game to continue filling the cells. If it has been won, leads directly to the "you won" screen.

Step 9b: Daily Refresh so that at 00:00 the game restarts for a new Bingo.

Step ??: Expand Database, automatizarlo, thousands of images...
